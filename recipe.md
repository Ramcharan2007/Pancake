1.Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Place 2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, 2     teaspoons baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine.
2.Add the wet ingredients. Add 1 1/2 cups milk, 2 large eggs, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Whisk until almost smooth, a few small lumps are fine.
3.Let the batter rest while you heat a pan. Set the batter aside for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a large cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
4.Fry 3 pancakes for 3 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil to the pan and swirl to coat. Add 2-tablespoon portions of the batter to the pan, cooking 3 at a time. Cook on the first side until bubbles appear on the surface, the edges begin to look dry, and the bottoms are golden-brown, about 3 minutes.
5.Flip and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the pancakes. Cook until the second sides are golden-brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a warm oven or plate. Repeat using more oil and cooking the remaining batter.
